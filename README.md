# few_1_2_final_project

for my final project for few_1_2, I'm going to build a portfolio website that I can use to showcase my coding projects, some writing, (my medium page)
, some photography (my Instagram page?), and some music (my souncloud?)




ideas: 
-generate a GIF from keywords in each article
-provide a link to each article after my essay on each article. 
-use Medium API, Instagram API, Soundcloud API (or just make a page with a few youtube vids)
