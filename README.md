# few_1_2_final_project

for my final project for few_1_2, I'm going to build a portfolio website that I can use to showcase my coding projects, some writing, (my medium page)
, some photography (my Instagram page?), and some music (my souncloud?)


# Roadmap 

- write readme
- outline project 
- create components 
- save screenshot pics for each project
