# few_1_2_final_project

for my final project for few_1_2, I'm going to incorporate my final S&L Communications class project, which is going to be an essay in turn incorporating all the papers I wrote in the S&L class over the course of the term, with pictures and wikipedia links to illustrate my points.

I plan to format the site just like a Medium page.

idea: generate a GIF from keywords in each article
